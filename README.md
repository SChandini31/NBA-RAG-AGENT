# AI Assistant for NBA Accreditation (RAG-Based)

This project is developed as part of the IBM SkillsBuild Internship to assist faculty during the NBA Accreditation process. It leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and IBM Watsonx Granite model for AI-driven guidance.

## Features
- Retrieves NBA guidelines and SAR formats
- AI-powered responses to queries (e.g., CO-PO mapping, SAR preparation)
- Conceptual prototype using RAG in Python

## Technologies Used
- IBM Watsonx Granite (planned for deployment)
- Langchain (RAG implementation)
- Python
- IBM Cloud Lite (for hosting)
- GitHub (version control)

## File Structure
- `rag_nba_agent.py`: Main prototype code
- `docs/nba_docs.txt`: Sample NBA documentation
- `requirements.txt`: Required Python libraries
- `README.md`: Project overview

## Note
This is a conceptual submission. IBM Cloud integration will follow after prototype validation.
